# Cloud Storage Server
An open source, extensible, self-hosted cloud storage API.  The base server implements a complete file system similar to Amazon Cloud Drive and other providers.

This tool is "experimental" at the moment.  It works but you are mostly on your own until documentation rolls out.

It uses the web server written entirely in PHP from the Ultimate Web Scraper Toolkit to implement the API.

It can also be used with CubicleSoft Service Manager to have it automatically start up when the system boots.

An example PHP SDK for the /files API is available in the CubicleSoft Cloud Backup solution (see support/sdk_cloud_storage_server_files.php).
